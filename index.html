I have been working in the logistics and supply chain industry for over a decade now working as an operations manager for a private firm. I came to Australia as a student and gradually fell in love with Melbourne and decided to settle down. I love dogs but now I have two cats; named Cisco(7 months) and Nora (8 Month). I adopted them this year and was the best decision contemplating the COVID situation.<br>
</p>

<p>I joined the course in IT as I love technology and would love to be doing something which I like. Also being in the logistic industry for too long have sparked me to get a change in career and to do something new. After a lot of researching into the different field, I came across IT as a career which needed a fair bit of qualification and certifications also the things that intrigued me the most was quick employment, variety of career opportunities, easy career growth and last but the most important that it pays well.</strong></p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Test results of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test:</h2>
  <img src="image2.png"> </img><br>
  <img src="image3.png"> </img><br>
 <img src="image4.png"> </img><br>
<p>The result for these test have given me more clarity on what are my qualities and definitely a few things I could work on to get the best of me . The other traits I saw were that I can manage people well with a confident personality. Also while going through the test results I noticed that I am more of a people person and do care about people around me and I can communicate with calm and can have more of a logical interaction. I am also very observant what people are doing around me which is also a good characteristic when working in a team. While choosing a team I would keep these points in mind from the three tests and choose people who are more open to conversations and definitely who can get along with my characteristics .</p>
<p><strong><u>Project idea</u>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The project idea I have come up is of developing an application to get your medicines home delivered within 30 minutes, or the medicine price would be given at a discount of 10 %.</p>
<p><strong><u>Overview</u></strong> </p>
<p> The idea behind developing this application would be making it convenient for customers to get their medicines delivered at home with just a click of a button they could just upload a snapshot of there prescription which then would be directed to the nearest medicine retailer to be shipped to the customer . I am also aware there are some medicine delivery application in the market but seeing their review and from my personal experience they are not very prompt with there service.well in this project our prime goal would be a speedy delivery which is like making the whole idea of medicine delivery prompt .</p>
<p><strong><u>Motivation</u>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The real motivation for building this application would be helping the older customers which can't go out and around looking for the medicines and also for the people who keep busy and having an application which could deliver the medicine in 30 minutes would make life easier for them. Seeing the lifestyle nowadays where technology has a big role in everybody's life and almost everyone uses a smartphone and would love to build an application which would deliver the medicines promptly with great customer satisfaction and helping the community.</p>
<p><strong><u>Description</u>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Well, the process of getting these medicines delivered on time would be a challenge and that means the whole process starting from the prescription of the medicine to be uploaded till it reaches the customer has to be prompt and without any loopholes or mistakes.</p>
<p>For this, I have thought of delegating the whole process into three major panels which are the pharmacy panel, customer panel and the admin panel so that there are no confusions and mistakes in the process and if in case of a fault we could know which panel could be made better so that there is no error again.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Pharmacy Panel</u>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<li>The customers can sign upto their pharmacy services on the medicine delivery aplication without a glitch with
  an straightforward-to-use interface.</li>
<li>	Pharmacists can use a user-friendly interface to handle and generate future orders.</li>
<li>	 Users can get notifications about the drug store purchases  they have made.</li>
<li>	The online medication app provides the ease of evaluating the prescriptions uploaded by the clients digitally.</li>
<li>	Inside the application, the Stores can receive payments directly and track their details as well.</li>
<li>	To attract the customer, the pharmacy stores can Interact and engage with them through push notifications </li>
<li>	Seamlessly add/ alter/ delete store details to give updated information to the customers.</li>
<p><strong><u>Customer Panel</u>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<li>	Users can join and log in to the application with their email, contact number, and password. </li>
<li>	The online medicine delivery application enables the users to maintain their information in the profile panel. </li>
<li>	Customers can effortlessly add prescriptions as guided by the doctor in the profile panel.</li>
<li>	Customers can search for specific medicines by inserting the name of the medication with all the important details. </li>
<p><strong><u>Admin Panel</u>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<li>	Admin confirms and views all the requests made by customers, store owners, in the window pane .</li>
<li>	The application enables multiple payment accesses so that payments can be made flawlessly, which also increases the business base.</li>
<li>	Data can be retrieved in various types by admin, which in this manner facilitates real-time analytics. </li>
<li>	 Admin, and the customers as well, can trace the orders put by customers at a variety of stores also on a real-time basis.</li> 
<li>	Find the best delivery routes using GPS enabled navigation systems to ensure the right-time delivery. </li>
<li>	 Customers get 24/7 assistance during emergency . </li>s

<p><strong><u>Tools & Technologies and skill required</u></strong></p>

Developing a mobile application has come a long way since the last decade technology is evolving at a rapid rate to make the user interface easier. Firstly we have the wort out to the people about the new application which is being introduced which can be done by using social media and advertisements .also tools like google analytics, new relic and A/B testing can be used to collect the information about the user usage of the application and know the likes and dislikes of the customer and the bugs and crashes could be fixed in the next release of the application. As the bug and fixes are added to the application it is always in the interest of the developers that the application is tested internally and externally by the testers and for this process to take place we can use one of the various tools in the market from which one of them Jenkins which frees the developer from going back to improving the app instead of spending time building and distributing the app. 
Also, keep in mind the delivery side of the marketing strategy we could partner up with some experts who could promise the deliver the product is under the given guidelines which are under 30 minutes.

<p><strong><u>Outcome</u></strong></p>
<p>Building of an application or an idea just doesn’t happen overnight it takes a lot of effort and tuning to turn it into a great idea. As we know there are applications there for home delivery of medicine but something like delivery in 30 mins would be a great idea as per the marketing strategy and for the benefit for the customers .as we have discussed in the above paragraph there are a lot of steps in building an application none of the steps could be missed to get an application in the market which is rewarded by the customer plus the customer plays a big part in helping to refine the application. If all goes well this application should take around 6 months to get into the market readily available to use. </p>
