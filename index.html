<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;"><strong style="color: #000000; font-size: 14px;">Hi, my name is Himanshu Sharma I am 32 years old and currently pursuing a graduate certificate in logistics and supply chain and bachelors in information technology from RMIT. I have previously done a degree in logistics from carrick institute. I was born in India and have been in Australia for about 14 yrs now.

<p><strong>I joined the course in IT as I love technology and would love to be doing something which I like.

<p><strong>The reason I chose RMIT as to get my education as they are the best in it plus holding a full-time job it makes it much easier when studying online also keeping in mind the course structure was put well together for a person who is just setting there first step into the field of information technology also a lot of my friends recommended me to go for RMIT as they have studied from there as well. I expect that the course would give me the confidence to step into the real world of IT and give me clarity towards what field of IT I could choose shortly as per my potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Cleaning options:</h2>
<p>The result for these test havegiven me a more clarity on what are my qualities and definitely afew things I could work on to get the best of me . The other traits i saw were true that i was a born leader i could manage people well with a confident personality. Also while going through the test results i noticed that i am more of a people person and do care about people around me and i can communicate easily with anyone with calm and can have more of a logical interaction. I am also very observant what people are doing around me which is also a good characteristic when working in a team. While choosing a team i would keep theses points in mind from the three tests and choose people who are more open to conversations and definitely who can get along with my characteristics .</p>

<p><strong>Project idea&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The project idea I have come up is of developing an application to get your medicines home delivered within 30 minutes&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>or the medicine price would be given at a discount of 10 %.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overview - The idea behind developing this application would be making it convenient for customers to get their medicines delivered at home with just a click of a button they could just upload a snapshot of there prescription which then would be directed to the nearest medicine retailer to be shipped to the customer . I am also aware there are some medicine delivery application in the market but seeing their review and from my personal experience they are not very prompt with there service.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Motivation&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The real motivation for building this application would be helping the older customers which can't go out and around looking for the medicines and also for the people who keep busy and having an application which could deliver the medicine in 30 minutes would make life easier for them. Seeing the lifestyle nowadays where technology has a big role in everybody's life and almost everyone uses a smartphone and would love to build an application which would deliver the medicines promptly with great customer satisfaction and helping the community.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Description&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well, the process of getting these medicines delivered on time would be a challenge and that means the whole process starting from the prescription of the medicine to be uploaded till it reaches the customer has to be prompt and without any loopholes or mistakes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For this, I have thought of delegating the whole process into three major panels which are the pharmacy panel, customer panel and the admin panel so that there are no confusions and mistakes in the process and if in case of a fault we could know which panel could be made better so that there is no error again.&nbsp;</strong></p>
