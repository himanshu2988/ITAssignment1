<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hi, my name is Himanshu Sharma I am 32 years old and currently pursuing a graduate certificate in logistics and supply chain and bachelors in information technology from RMIT. I have previously done a degree in logistics from carrick institute. I was born in India and have been in Australia for about 14 yrs now. I have been working in the logistics and supply chain industry for over a decade now working as an operations manager for a private firm .i came to Australia as a student and gradually over the time fell in love with Melbourne and decided to settle down here. I love cats have two of them named cisco and Nora. I like playing basketball and working out during my spare time.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I joined the course in IT as I love technology and would love to be doing something which I like. Also being in the logistic industry for too long have sparked me to get a change in career and to do something new. After a lot of researching into the different field, I came across IT as a career which needed a fair bit of qualification and certifications also the things that intrigued me the most was quick employment, variety of career opportunities, easy career growth and last but the most important that it pays well.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The reason I chose RMIT as to get my education as they are the best in it plus holding a full-time job it makes it much easier when studying online also keeping in mind the course structure was put well together for a person who is just setting there first step into the field of information technology also a lot of my friends recommended me to go for RMIT as they have studied from there as well. I expect that the course would give me the confidence to step into the real world of IT and give me clarity towards what field of IT I could choose shortly as per my potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
